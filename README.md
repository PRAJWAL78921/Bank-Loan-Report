# Bank Loan Report Query and Analysis using SQL  

## Description  
Developed an **end-to-end SQL project** that generates **key insights and performance indicators** of the bank's loan portfolio.  
This project involved writing **complex SQL queries** to extract data on:  
- **Loan applications**  
- **Funded amounts**  
- **Payment collections**  
- **Interest rates**  

Additionally, **KPIs were analyzed** based on various factors such as:  
- **Periods** (MTD: Month-to-Date, PMTD: Prior Month-to-Date)  
- **Loan status** (Good vs. Bad Loans)  
- **Borrower demographics** (State, Term, Employment Length, Home Ownership)

## Key Features  
âœ” **Total Applications and Amounts Funded**  
âœ” **Monthly and Prior Month Loan Application and Payment Insights**  
âœ” **Overview of Loan Status: Good vs. Bad Loans**  
âœ” **Interest Rates and Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio Analysis**  
âœ” **Distribution of Loans by State and Purpose**  
âœ” **Data Exploration using Multiple Filters in Dashboards**  
âœ” **Borrower Queries based on:**
  - **Employment Length**  
  - **Home Ownership**  
  - **Loan Purpose**

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL** (Data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis)  
- **Excel** (Dashboard creation for insights)  

Data **filtering and comparison** were implemented using various **interactive filters** in the **Excel dashboard**, allowing for a **detailed breakdown of loan metrics**.  

---

## Insights & Impact  
- **Analyzed key loan metrics** to assess portfolio performance.  
- **Extracted actionable insights** for **better financial decision-making**.  
- **Developed SQL queries** that helped in **understanding borrower trends** and **loan repayment behavior**.  
- **Presented results visually** using **Excel dashboards** to enhance data interpretation.

## Future Enhancements  
ðŸ“Œ **Integrate Power BI or Tableau** for more advanced visualizations.  
ðŸ“Œ **Optimize SQL queries** for faster processing of large datasets.  
ðŸ“Œ **Expand the dataset** to include more variables for deeper analysis.  
ðŸ“Œ **Automate report generation** using stored procedures and scheduling tools.
